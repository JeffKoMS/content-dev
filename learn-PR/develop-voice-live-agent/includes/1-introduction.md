Voice-enabled applications are transforming how we interact with technology, and this module guides you through building a real-time, interactive voice solutions using advanced APIs and tools.

Imagine you're a developer at a mid-sized tech company tasked with creating a voice-enabled customer support application for a retail client. The client wants the app to provide real-time, natural-sounding interactions, including speech recognition, text-to-speech synthesis, and even an avatar that visually represents the assistant. You need to ensure low-latency communication, seamless event handling, and robust functionality. Additionally, the client requires the app to be scalable and hosted in the cloud, leveraging Azure services for deployment. This project demands expertise in integrating APIs, managing real-time audio streams, and deploying a fully functional web app. Without the right tools and knowledge, delivering such a solution efficiently could be a significant challenge.

After completing this module, you'll be able to:

- Implement the Azure AI Voice Live API to enable real-time, bidirectional communication.
- Set up and configure the agent session.
- Develop and manage event handlers to create dynamic and interactive user experiences.
- Build and deploy a Python-based web app with real-time voice interaction capabilities to Azure.
