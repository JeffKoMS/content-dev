Module: Stream and Coordinate Events in Azure Redis (Intermediate-Level)
This training module is divided into four units, each focusing on Azure Cache for Redis’s event messaging features. The units combine conceptual overviews with code examples, and each provides links to official documentation or sample projects for deeper exploration.


Pub/Sub Overview – Explains the publish/subscribe pattern in Azure Cache for Redis. This unit covers how publishers send messages to channels and how multiple subscribers can receive those messages in real-time, enabling loosely coupled, asynchronous communication. You’ll learn that Azure Cache for Redis (based on Redis) can act as a high-throughput message broker for event-driven apps. Important characteristics (and limitations) are highlighted – e.g. Redis Pub/Sub delivers messages at-most-once and does not persist them. Subscribers only get messages while actively connected (if a subscriber is offline or late, it misses those events). This unit sets the foundation for understanding real-time event distribution and when to use Pub/Sub (such as broadcasting notifications or cache invalidation signals).

Streaming with Redis Streams – Introduces Redis Streams, a data structure for event streaming available in Azure Cache for Redis (Redis 5.0+). This unit explains how Streams differ from Pub/Sub and when to use them for more reliable event processing. Unlike Pub/Sub, a Redis Stream is a persistent log of events: messages are stored on the server and can be read by clients at their own pace or even replayed later. You’ll learn about at-least-once delivery: consumers can acknowledge processing, and if one fails to ack, the message remains pending for recovery – providing higher reliability for critical events. The concept of consumer groups is covered as well. Consumer groups let you have multiple subscribers on the same stream without each getting duplicate messages. Instead, the stream entries are divided among group members, enabling horizontal scaling of consumers for throughput or workload segregation. This unit includes scenarios where Streams are ideal (audit logs, event sourcing, task queues that require persistence) and how to use Redis commands like XADD (to append events) and XREAD/XREADGROUP (to read events, optionally via consumer groups).

Publishing Events (Hands-on) – This practical unit shows how to implement an event publisher using Azure Cache for Redis. It provides code examples (in C# with the StackExchange.Redis client and/or other languages as needed) for connecting to the Redis cache and sending messages. For example, using the .NET client you can obtain an ISubscriber from the Redis connection and call Publish() to send a message on a channel. A demo might illustrate a simple loop broadcasting ten messages to a channel (e.g. "events:updates"), with a brief delay between publishes. The unit explains how published events immediately fan out to all subscribers listening on that channel. It also touches on best practices like choosing channel naming conventions and handling connection strings/credentials for Azure Cache for Redis. By the end, you’ll know how to integrate Redis event publishing into your applications (for instance, to notify web clients of updates or to trigger processing in background services).

Coordinating Multiple Subscribers – Discusses patterns to manage multiple consumers for the same event stream. First, it covers the default Pub/Sub behavior: if you simply have two or more subscribers on a Redis channel, each subscriber will receive every message published to that channel (i.e. the message is duplicated to all listeners). This is great for broadcast scenarios, but not for work distribution. The unit then explains how to coordinate subscribers when you don’t want duplicate processing. Here you revisit Redis Streams consumer groups as the solution for load balancing and coordination. In a consumer group, each message in the stream is delivered to only one member of the group, so subscribers can split the workload (each processing a different subset of messages). You’ll learn the basics of setting up a consumer group (using the XGROUP CREATE command or client API) and how consumers in the group use XREADGROUP to fetch new events. The unit also notes that consumer groups track message state and use acknowledgements (XACK) – if one subscriber fails, another can claim pending messages – ensuring no event is lost and enabling at-least-once processing. By the end, you’ll understand how Azure Redis can support multiple subscribers either in a classic broadcast mode (Pub/Sub) or a coordinated, scalable processing mode (Streams with consumer groups).

Each unit above builds toward enabling event-driven architectures with Azure Cache for Redis. By focusing on Redis Pub/Sub and Streams (instead of external services), developers learn to implement real-time communication within their Azure solutions. This module’s content and linked resources will equip you to decide when to use simple Pub/Sub vs. durable Streams, and how to implement each in your Azure applications with confidence and best practices.
