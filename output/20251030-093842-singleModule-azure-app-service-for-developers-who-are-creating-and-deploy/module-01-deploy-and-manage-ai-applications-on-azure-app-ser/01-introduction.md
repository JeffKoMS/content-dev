# Introduction

_Unit type: Introduction | Estimated duration: 5 minutes_

## Learning objectives

- Evaluate Azure App Service deployment options for AI applications and select appropriate hosting plans
- Configure Azure App Service to securely integrate Azure OpenAI Service and Azure AI Services
- Implement managed identity authentication to connect AI services without storing credentials
- Monitor AI application performance and costs using Azure Application Insights and App Service diagnostics

Your retail company just launched a customer-facing web portal that provides personalized product recommendations using Azure OpenAI Service. During the first week, traffic exceeded expectations by 300%, causing intermittent slowdowns and timeout errors. Your operations team scrambled to scale infrastructure manually, while your security team flagged API keys stored in configuration files as a compliance risk. As the cloud engineer responsible for production AI workloads, you need a hosting platform that scales automatically, integrates securely with Azure AI services, and provides visibility into performance and costs.

Azure App Service offers a fully managed platform that eliminates the infrastructure complexity of deploying AI applications. With built-in auto-scaling triggered by real-time metrics, your recommendation engine adapts to traffic spikes without manual intervention. Managed identity authentication replaces hardcoded API keys, satisfying your security team's zero-trust requirements. Application Insights automatically tracks AI service dependencies, token consumption, and response times, giving your operations team the telemetry needed to optimize costs and maintain SLA commitments. By the end of this module, you'll deploy a production-ready AI application that integrates Azure OpenAI Service and Azure AI Services using secure authentication patterns, with monitoring configured to surface performance bottlenecks and cost drivers.

## Learning objectives

By the end of this module, you'll be able to:

- Evaluate Azure App Service deployment options for AI applications and select appropriate hosting plans
- Configure Azure App Service to securely integrate Azure OpenAI Service and Azure AI Services
- Implement managed identity authentication to connect AI services without storing credentials
- Monitor AI application performance and costs using Azure Application Insights and App Service diagnostics

## Prerequisites

- Familiarity with Azure fundamentals and the Azure portal
- Basic understanding of RESTful APIs and web application architecture
- Experience with at least one programming language (Python, C#, or JavaScript)
- Completion of Microsoft Learn module: 'Introduction to Azure App Service' or equivalent knowledge

## Enhancement suggestions

- High-level architecture diagram showing Azure App Service hosting a web application that integrates with Azure OpenAI Service for product recommendations and Azure AI Services for image analysis, with Application Insights monitoring the solution and users accessing through a web browser. Include visual indicators for managed identity authentication flow and auto-scaling triggers.

## Accessibility notes

Provide detailed alt text describing the architectural flow from end users through Azure App Service to AI services, emphasizing the monitoring layer and data flow for screen reader users.
